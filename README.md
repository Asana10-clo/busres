## Using pipenv (optional)
Pipenv is used to manage python packages just like npm is used to manage javascript packages.

- First, install pipenv
```cmd
pip install pipenv
```

- Move into the code directory
```cmd
pipenv install
```

## Issues
- [ ] Frontend styling needs improvement
- Especially the text color inside of the dropdown menu
